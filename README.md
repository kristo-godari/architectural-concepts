# Architecture concepts

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to share a variety of architectural concepts and patterns that I have employed over the course of my career as a software engineer. 
I aim to elucidate the appropriate situations in which each concept or pattern is best used, as well as highlighting the respective benefits and drawbacks of each. 
Currently, the project exists solely as a rudimentary proof of concept; however, I intend to expand and refine its contents in the near future

## Sub projects
- Component based architecture
- Design patterns
